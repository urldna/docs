from urldna import UrlDNA

# Initialize the client with your API key (available in your profile)
api_key = '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
client = UrlDNA(api_key)
```

### Create a scan
```python
url = 'https://urldna.io'

# Create a new scan and wait until the scan status is DONE or ERROR
scan_result = client.create_scan(url) 
```

```python
url = 'https://urldna.io'

# Create a new scan and return the scan object while its status is still PENDING or RUNNING
scan = client.async_create_scan(url)
scan_id = scan.id # Use this id to fecth scan result
```

### Get a scan
```python
scan_result = client.get_scan(scan_id)

# Print various scan results
print(scan_result.cookies)           # List of cookies found on the webpage
print(scan_result.dom)               # Full HTML source code of the page
print(scan_result.favicon)           # Favicon details, including hash and URL
print(scan_result.http_transactions) # List of all HTTP requests and responses
print(scan_result.ip_address)        # IP address associated with the scanned URL
print(scan_result.scan_whois)        # WHOIS registration details
print(scan_result.malicious)         # Indicates whether the URL is flagged as malicious (beta feature)
print(scan_result.page)              # Extracted meta tags, headers, and text content
print(scan_result.screenshot)        # URL of the captured webpage screenshot
print(scan_result.technologies)      # List of detected technologies used on the site
print(scan_result.scan_feedback)     # User-submitted feedback on the scan

```

### Scan feedback
```python
# Submit user feedback for a scan (marking the URL as MALICIOUS or SAFE)
scan_feedback = client.scan_feedback(scan_id, "MALICIOUS")  
print(scan_feedback.malicious_count)  # Number of users who marked this as malicious
```

### Fast Check
```python
url = 'https://urldna.io'

# Perform a quick reputation check on the URL (returns cached results if available)
response = client.fast_check(url)
print(response.status)  # Possible values: MALICIOUS, SAFE, or UNRATED

```
