## Overview

The **Scan** object represents a comprehensive view of a scanned webpage, including metadata, status, and other relevant attributes. This page details the scan lifecycle and attributes, both for newly created scans and completed scan results.

## Scan Lifecycle

When a new scan is created, it follows these status transitions:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    PENDING -->|Queued for processing| RUNNING;
    RUNNING -->|Processing complete| DONE;
    RUNNING -->|Connection issues| ERROR;
```

* **PENDING**: The scan is waiting in the queue.

* **RUNNING**: The scan is being processed.

* **DONE**: The scan has completed successfully, and all attributes are available.

* **ERROR**: There was a connection issue, preventing the scan from completing.

## New Scan

When creating a new scan, several attributes can be configured to customize the scanning process:

* **Submitted URL**: The URL to be scanned must be a valid and properly formatted URL. If no protocol (e.g., `http://` or `https://`) is provided, the system will automatically assume `https://`.

* **Scanned From**: Specifies the list of countries from which the scan is performed. By default, scans originate from the **DEFAULT** country unless a premium option is selected.

* **Visibility**: Determines who can view the scan results. Options include:

  * **Public**: The scan is visible to all users.

* **Device**: Determines whether the scan is performed using a **mobile** or **desktop** device.
