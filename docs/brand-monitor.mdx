## Overview

The **Brand Monitoring** feature in urlDNA is designed to help premium users track potential phishing threats targeting their brands. This feature leverages the custom urlDNA Engine AI to identify and display recent scans that match specific brands.

## Access & Limitations

* The **Brand Monitoring** feature is **only available for premium users**.

* Users can add up to **10 brands** to monitor.

* To **remove a monitored brand**, users must contact urlDNA support.

## Adding a Monitored Brand

* A **search bar** allows users to filter and find brands available in the system.

* If a brand is not listed, users can **request to add it** via a dedicated form.

## Built-in Brand Lists

1. **User Monitored Brands**: Brands that the user has specifically chosen to track (up to 10 brands).

2. **urlDNA Selected Brands**: A predefined list of top brands that the system provides access to without requiring them to be added to the userâ€™s monitored brands.

## How It Works

1. Search for a brand using the search bar.

2. Select the brand to monitor.

3. If your brand is missing, submit a request through the form.

4. View a list of recent scans that match the monitored brand.
