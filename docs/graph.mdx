## Overview

The **urlDNA Scan Graph** transforms traditional flat scan reports into an interactive network graph.  
Instead of scrolling through long scan details, analysts can visually explore how URLs, domains, IPs, certificates, technologies, and other attributes connect to each other.

The Scan Graph provides immediate context, uncovers hidden relationships, and accelerates threat investigation.

## Key Features

### Forced Connected Graph

All scan attributes are displayed as interconnected nodes in a dynamic **force-directed graph**.  
Each node represents an entity such as:

- URL  
- Redirect  
- Domain  
- IP address  
- Favicon
- Screenshot
- ISP
- ASN

This allows analysts to quickly understand the underlying structure and relationships within a scan.

### Intuitive Interaction

The graph is fully interactive:

- Click any node to expand related data points  
- Visualize how a single attribute—such as a domain or certificate—links to multiple scans  
- Seamlessly build multi-layered, contextual investigation views  

This exploration-first design makes it easier to uncover patterns and connections that might be missed in static scan reports.

### Flexible Starting Points

You can launch a graph from:

- A **specific scan result**, to analyze its environment  
- A **search query**, to correlate multiple scans at once  

This supports both targeted investigations and broad threat-hunting use cases.

### Custom Graph Storage

Premium users can **save** and **load** custom-built investigation graphs, preserving:

- Node layout  
- Expanded relationships  
- Selected entities and attributes  

This feature enables:

- Reusable threat models  
- Long-term investigations  
- Consistent and sharable correlation views  
- Easier return to ongoing analytical work  

### Actionable Visual Insights

The Scan Graph helps analysts:

- Identify clusters of malicious infrastructure  
- Trace phishing operations and campaigns  
- Detect shared elements (IPs, certificates, technologies, trackers)  
- Follow data trails to uncover hidden relationships  

Complex threat landscapes become intuitive and visually navigable.

## Settings

The Scan Graph includes a **Settings** panel that allows PREMIUM users to personalize the way their visual investigations behave.

### Custom Filters (Similar to *My Queries*)

Users can apply **custom search filters** to shape the data loaded into the graph.  
These filters function similarly to **My Queries**, enabling you to:

- Restrict expanded nodes to specific attributes  
- Apply brand-specific or threat-specific criteria  
- Avoid loading irrelevant or low-priority data  
- Maintain consistent investigation logic across sessions  

This ensures that each graph expansion only pulls the data that matters most to your workflow.

### Max Child Nodes Per Search

To maintain graph clarity and control performance, users can define the **maximum number of child nodes** that each expansion can load.

You can:

- Set a global limit for all node types  
- Prevent overly large expansions from cluttering the graph  
- Keep graph structures focused and manageable  
- Tune performance for your device or browser  

This provides a balance between deep exploration and visual clarity.

## Conclusion

The **urlDNA Scan Graph** provides a powerful visual method for analyzing and correlating scan data.  
By converting flat reports into an explorable network—and supporting saved graphs, filters, and customization—premium users gain deeper insight, faster workflows, and complete control over how their investigations unfold.
