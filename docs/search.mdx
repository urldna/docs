## Overview

The urlDNA search feature leverages a powerful **Custom Query Language (CQL)** to help you find relevant scan results quickly and efficiently. With CQL, you can craft precise queries using multiple attributes and operators, allowing for flexible and targeted searches.

## Why Use CQL?

* **Precision**: Find exactly what you're looking for with attribute-based searches.

* **Flexibility**: Combine multiple conditions to refine results.

* **Efficiency**: Reduce search time by narrowing down results.

## CQL Syntax

A CQL query follows a simple format:

```
ATTRIBUTE OPERATOR VALUE
```

For example:

```
title LIKE facebook
```

This query finds results where the page title contains "facebo".

## Searchable Attributes

Here are the key attributes you can use in your queries:

* `id`: Scan ID (e.g., `660d0...`)

* `domain`: Scan domain name (e.g., `"google.com"`)

* `submitted_url`: Submitted URL for the scan (e.g., `"https://www.google.com/search"`)

* `nsfw`: Flag for adult content (`true/false`)

* `target_url`: Redirected URL after the initial scan

* `device`: Device used (`MOBILE/DESKTOP`)

* `user_agent`: Web browser user agent string

* `scanned_from`: Country from which the scan was made

* `submitter_tag`: User submitter tags

* `origin`: Source of the scan (`USER/API/TELEGRAM`)

* `title`: Page title

* `ip`: IP address used to access the website

* `org`: Organization associated with the IP

* `isp`: Internet Service Provider for the IP

* `asn`: Autonomous System Number associated with the IP

* `city`: City associated with the IP

* `http_transaction`: HTTP transactions URL

* `outgoing_link`: Page outgoing link

* `country_code`: Country code associated with the IP

* `favicon`: Hash of the website's favicon image

* `screenshot`: Hash of the website's screenshot

* `registrar`: Whois registrar attribute

* `serial_number`: Certificate serial number (for SSL certificates)

* `issuer`: Certificate issuer (for SSL certificates)

* `subject`: Certificate subject (for SSL certificates)

* `malicious`: Flag for malicious website (`true/false`)

* `technology`: Technologies used by the website

* `cookie_name`: Name of a specific cookie found on the website

* `cookie_value`: Value of a specific cookie found on the website

## Operators

Use the following operators to refine your searches:

| Operator | Description                           | Example                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `=`      | Matches exact values                  | `domain = www.google.com` |
| `!=`     | Excludes specific values              | `domain != facebook.com`  |
| `LIKE`   | Partial match based on a pattern      | `title LIKE Login`        |
| `!LIKE`  | Excludes results containing a pattern | `domain !LIKE amazon`     |

## Combining Conditions

You can use the `AND` keyword to combine multiple conditions:

```
domain = www.google.com AND title LIKE search
```

This query finds scans associated with "google.com" where the title contains the word "search".

## Examples

Find all scans from mobile devices in Italy:

```
device = MOBILE AND country_code = IT
```

Identify scans where the favicon hash matches a specific value:

```
favicon LIKE d417e43...
```

Locate all non-malicious websites using WordPress:

```
malicious = false AND technology LIKE wordpress
```

By leveraging the urlDNA search function, you can efficiently retrieve relevant scan data, filter results, and gain deeper insights into potential threats or patterns.
