## Overview

The **My Query** feature in urlDNA allows authenticated users to save and recover custom queries. This enables users to efficiently store frequently used search filters and retrieve them later without re-entering the criteria manually.

## Creating a My Query

Users can create a My Query by defining the following parameters:

* **Query Name**: A unique name to identify the saved query.

* **Filters**: Users can add one or more filters to define search criteria.

**Filter Structure**

Each filter consists of:

* **Attribute**: A selectable list of all searchable attributes.

* **Operator**: Defines the matching condition, which can be:

  * `=` (equals)

  * `!=` (not equals)

  * `LIKE` (contains)

  * `!LIKE` (does not contain)

* **Value**: The input value to match against the selected attribute.

Filters within a My Query are combined using a **logical AND** operator, meaning all conditions must be met for a result to be returned.

## Managing My Queries

Users can:

* Add new filters to an existing My Query.

* Remove filters from a My Query.

* Update the name of a My Query.

* Delete saved queries when no longer needed.

## Quick Action: Save Search as My Query

A quick way to generate a My Query is from the **Search** page. After performing a search, users can save the current search filters as a new My Query for future use.
