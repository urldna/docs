## Overview

The **urlDNA AI Playground** is an advanced AI-powered feature that allows users to interact with scan results using natural language queries. This functionality is available exclusively to **premium users**, who can send up to **5 requests per day**.

## Features

* **AI-Powered Chat:** Users can ask questions in human language about a scan, and the engine will respond accordingly.

* **Custom Response Format:** By default, responses are provided in **Markdown format**.

* **JSON Template Support:** Users can specify a valid JSON response template, and the engine will populate it with relevant scan information.

## JSON Output Template

When requesting JSON output, users must provide a valid template. The AI Engine will then populate the template with the relevant scan data. An example template is:

```json
{
    "summary": "page text summary",
    "domain": "domain name",
    "url": "scan URL",
    "safe": "true if page is safe otherwise false"
}
```

## Examples

Users can interact with the AI Playground using various types of queries, such as:

* **General Explanation**

```plaintext
Explain me why this scan is malicious.
```

* **Structured Data Extraction**

```plaintext
Extract results using template.
```

```json
{
    "summary": "page text summary",
    "domain": "domain name",
    "url": "scan URL",
    "safe": "true if page is safe otherwise false"
}
```

## Usage Guidelines

* Only **premium users** have access to this feature.

* Each user is limited to **5 requests per day**.

* Ensure that the JSON response template provided is **valid** and **well-formed** to receive structured output.

## How It Works

1. The user submits a query related to a scan.

2. The **urlDNA AI Engine** processes the request and extracts relevant insights.

3. The engine responds in Markdown by default or fills the provided JSON template with scan-related information.
